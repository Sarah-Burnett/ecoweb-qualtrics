    The ECoWeB study is only looking for young adults aged from 16-22 years old.
    &nbsp; This is because we have been funded to test whether the&nbsp;app promotes 
    well-being and prevents poor mental health specifically in this age group. 
    As you are either under 16 or over 22, you are unable to take part. 
    Thank you for your interest

    Sorry, but we are only looking for participants from the UK, Belgium, 
    Germany and Spain as this is where we have funding and ethical consent 
    to invite people to take part.  Thank you for your interest.
