  <p>Dear&nbsp;${q://QID1366/ChoiceTextEntryValue/1},</p>
  <p>
    This is a gentle reminder to please complete our follow up survey so we know
    how you have been getting on with the app.
  </p>
  <p>
    We appreciate you have probably been busy with other things so may not yet
    have had time to help us with the survey. If you could complete at least
    part 1 of the survey that would be extremely helpful.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thank you for being part of our research study. It’s thanks to you that we
    can learn more about what helps young people stay well.
  </p>
  <p>
    As part of this research we need to know how you are doing now compared to
    how you were at the start of the study. Completing the survey again will
    really help us understand how emotions change and what helps to improve
    well-being. Thank you for your valuable help You will also have the
    opportunity to tell us what you liked and didn’t like at the end of the
    survey.
  </p>
  <p>
    On completion of both parts of the survey you will be eligible for a £10
    reward. You will be emailed or texted instructions on how to claim your
    rewards earnt on the App and from completing your follow up surveys shortly
    after you complete your 3 and 12 month follow up surveys.
