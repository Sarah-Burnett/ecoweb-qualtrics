    <strong>What do we mean by Clinical Depression?</strong></p>
    
    <p><br></p><p>When we talk about clinical depression, we don’t mean just feeling a bit sad, down or depressed for a few hours or day. Clinical depression is not just the low mood that we all experience some of time, but rather a serious illness.</p><p><br></p>
    
    <p>To be diagnosed as having “clinical” depression (typically called major depression), you need to experience <b>at least 5 of the following symptoms </b>and they each need to last <b>all day every day continuously for at least two weeks</b>, and to interfere with your ability to work or study and your relationships with family and friends:</p><p><br></p>
    
    <ul>
     <li>Depressed mood (feeling unhappy and down) most of the day, nearly every day</li>
     <li>Losing interest in all activities and not enjoying anything</li>
     <li>Finding it hard to make decisions or to concentrate</li>
     <li>Feeling tired all day every day</li>
     <li>Feeling restless/agitated or conversely really slowed down</li>
     <li>A big loss (or gain) in appetite and/or weight</li>
     <li>Sleeping more or less than normal</li>
     <li>Feeling useless, inadequate and hopeless</li>
     <li>Repeated thinking about death, suicide or harming yourself</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>​</p><p>If you have ever experienced at least 5 of these symptoms most of the day every day for at least 2 weeks, then you are not suitable for the ECoWeB study because it is focused on prevention and health promotion.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><b>If you are currently experiencing at least 5 of these symptoms most of the day every day for at least 2 weeks then you should seek help from your GP or family doctor.</b></p><p><b><br></b></p>

    <strong>What do we mean by bipolar disorder?</strong></p>
    
    <p><br></p><p>Bipolar disorder involves your moods swinging from one extreme to another. It was previously called manic depression. It typically involves periods of clinical depression and periods of feeling very high, positive or agitated and overactive, known as mania.</p>
    
    <p><br></p><p>Mania is not just feeling good or positive. To be diagnosed as “mania”, at least 3 of the following symptoms need to be present nearly every day for at least one week, and to interfere with your ability to work or study and your relationships with family and friends:</p><div><br></div>
    <ul><li>Inflated sense of self-esteem or grandiose thoughts (feeling very self-important<br>
    <li>Having what seem like great new ideas and very (over) ambitious plans<br>
    <li>Feeling very happy, elated or overjoyed (a prolonged high feeling)<br>
    <li>Talking more and talking very quickly&nbsp;<br>
    <li>Decreased need for sleep<br>
    <li>Being easily distracted<br>
    <li>Feeling quite agitated and finding it hard to stay still<br>
    <li>Being much more active than normal<br>
    <li>Doing things that could have painful consequences and that others see as risky or harmful, often out of character, e.g., spending sprees, gambling,
    </ul><p><br></p><p>Bipolar disorder would normally only be diagnosed after seeing a specialist doctor such as a psychiatrist.</p>
    
    <p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>If you have ever experienced mania, then your GP or a mental health professional would be the best person to contact regarding help and support.&nbsp; As the ECoWeB study is focused on preventing mental health difficulties rather than treating exisiting problems, taking part in the trial would not be right for you.</strong></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    
    <p><strong>What do we mean by psychosis?</strong></p>
    
    <p><br></p><p>Psychosis is a mental health problem where people perceive or interpret things differently from those around them. It typically involves delusions and/or hallucinations.</p>
    
    <p><br></p><p>A hallucination is where a person hears, sees or feels, tastes and smells things that do not exist outside their mind but that feel very real to them. The most common form is hearing voices, where the person experiences the sound of voices talking when the speaker is not present.</p>
    
    <p><br></p><p>A delusion is holding a strong belief that is not shared by others, e.g. someone believing that there is a conspiracy to harm them.</p>
    
    <p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>You should see a GP / family doctor immediately if you are experiencing the symptoms of psychosis. As the ECoWeB study is focused on preventing mental health difficulties rather than treating exisiting problems taking part in the trial would not be right for you.</strong></p>

<!-- first question-->
<p><b>Mental Health Help</b></p><p><b><br></b></p>
<p><b>Poor Mental Health:</b></p><p><b><br></b></p>
<p>
If you are struggling with poor mental health and it is interfering with your daily life, then the first thing to do is to seek help from your family doctor or GP.
​You can contact your GP using the normal telephone number for your GP practice. If the surgery is not open, you will either be re-directed automatically to the out-of-hours GP service or you will be given another number to call. You can also phone <a href="tel:111">111</a> to access the NHS 111 service, which provides access to local NHS healthcare services in England, and is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.
</p>
<p><b><br></b></p><p><b>Feeling suicidal:</b></p><p><b><br></b></p>
<p><b>
If you have been thinking about suicide or about hurting yourself, we strongly recommend that you contact your general practitioner or family doctor RIGHT AWAY for advice and tell them how you are feeling.&nbsp;</b></p><p><br></p><p>Having thoughts of suicide is nothing to be ashamed of and we encourage you to tell someone how you are feeling. There are lots of people available to listen and help you. Talk to your trusted person, call your GP, ring <a href="tel:111">111</a>, or the Samaritans on <a href="tel:116 123">116 123</a>, or any of the other helplines below.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>If you don't think you can stay safe, please go to the nearest hospital accident and emergency room. If none of these options are available, please contact a family member or a trusted friend, so that you won't be alone right now. It’s important to seek out the company of people who can support you and who will help to keep you safe.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>If you're feeling like you need to harm yourself, take steps to keep yourself safe:
</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s important to seek out the company of people who can support you and who will help to keep you safe.</li><li>Try to commit to a plan of action that does not involve suicide.
</li><li>If you have items that maybe dangerous for you at home, please consider giving them to a trusted friend, neighbour, the police or a pharmacist for safe keeping until you feel stronger.
</li><li>Try to minimise the use of alcohol or illicit drugs, as using these substances are likely to make your recovery harder.
</li><li>It is important to remember that these feelings and urges do pass, and when individuals feel better, they are glad that they did not act on them.
</li><li>There are effective treatments that can help, and there is no need to struggle alone.
</li><li>There may be reasons for hope that you have yet to consider.
</li><li>Sometimes the smallest reasons for living can get you through a difficult time.
</li><li>It can also be helpful to think about your faith, loved ones, family and pets.
</li>

<!-- second question -->
<p><b>Self-Help for Poor Mental Health</b></p><p><b><br></b></p>
There are several things that you can do to help look after yourself.
<ul><li><b>Seek help</b>: Talk to your doctor or another health professional or a school/university counsellor to get the best help.
</li><li><b> Talk to someone</b>: It is a good idea to not keep problems and upsets to yourself – talking to someone close to you, and telling them how you feel, sharing your concerns, and asking for help can help to come to terms with upsetting events.
</li><li><b> Do something</b>:  It is a good idea to be active. Being physically active can improve mood, and exercise can itself have antidepressant effects. Getting outside and seeing the natural world can be beneficial. As best you can, try and do things that you enjoy and value. It is easy to stop doing positive things when depressed, so it is a good idea to build these up. Try and build things up in small steps.
</li><li><b> Look after yourself physically</b>:  As best you can, try to eat regularly and healthily. When feeling unwell, it is easy to either skip meals or eat badly, which only worsens how you feel. Similarly, be careful with alcohol and drugs like cannabis – many people use alcohol and drugs to relax and numb their distress, but they actually make moods worse. Try and have a regular sleep routine – going to bed at the same time and getting up at the same time.
</li><li><b> Connect with others</b>: When feeling down, it is easy to withdraw from others. Mixing with others and getting involved with friends and family can help your mood. Helping other people can also improve your mood.
</li><li><b> Tackle problems</b>: If there is an underlying difficulty, trying to solve this problem might help. Write down the problem, all the different things you could to tackle it and then try the option that is most likely to help.
</li><li><b> Stay hopeful</b>: Whilst it may not feel like it, you will eventually feel better – most people recover and there are helpful treatments.
