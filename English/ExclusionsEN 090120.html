    The ECoWeB study is only looking for young adults aged from 16-22 years old.&nbsp; This is because we have been funded to test whether the&nbsp;app promotes well-being and prevents poor mental health specifically in this age group. As you are either under 16 or over 22, you are unable to take part. Thank you for your interest

<!-- Past depression -->
<p><strong>Your response(s) suggest you </strong><span style="font-weight: 700;">have experienced clinical depression in the past. At at least one point in your life,&nbsp;</span><strong>your overall mood has been low for at least 2 weeks and has had a negative effect on your life.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><br></p><p></p><p>The ECoWeB study has been funded to improve wellbeing and prevent poor mental health in young adults that have had no problems until now. Unfortunately, the current study is not suitable for anyone who has a history of depression. Thank you for your interest.</p><p><br></p><p></p><p>If you currently experiencing symptoms of depression, or if they return in the future, then we strongly recommend that you talk to your general practitioner, family doctor or a mental health professional about your difficulties, as he or she may be able to find ways to help you to improve your mood and handle life’s difficulties better. If you find your symptoms particularly distressing or have thoughts about ending your life then please go to the nearest emergency room, or immediately contact your GP.</p><p><br></p><p>If you have not had a health check recently that may also be worth doing so. If you have a diagnosis of depression, please make sure that you follow your treatment regime and consult with the medical professionals involved in your care.</p><p><br></p><p><b>We strongly recommend that you talk to your general practitioner, family doctor or a mental health professional about your difficulties</b>, as he or she may be able to find ways to help you to improve your mood and handle life’s difficulties better.&nbsp;<strong>Contact your GP </strong>using the normal telephone number for your GP practice. If the surgery is not open, you will either be re-directed automatically to the out-of-hours GP service or you will be given another number to call. You can also <strong>phone <a href="tel:111">111</a> to access the NHS 111 service</strong>, which provides access to local NHS healthcare services in England, and is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.</p><br> There are two main types of treatment for depression: talking therapies such as counselling and cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) and antidepressant medication.

Being physically active can improve mood, and exercise can itself have antidepressant effects. Getting outside and seeing the natural world can be benefical. As best you can, try and do things that you enjoy and value. It is easy to stop doing positive things when depressed, so it is a good idea to build these up. Try and build things up in small steps.</li><li><strong>Look after yourself physically:</strong> As best you can, try to eat regularly and healthily. When feeling down, it is easy to either skip meals or eat badly, which only worsens how you feel. Similarly, be careful with alcohol and drugs like cannabis – many people use alcohol and drugs to relax and numb their distress, but they actually make depression worse. Try and have a regular sleep routine – going to bed at the same time and getting up at the same time.</li><li><strong>Connect with others:</strong> When feeling down, it is easy to withdraw from others. Mixing with others and getting involved with friends and family can help your mood. Helping other people can also improve your mood.</li><li><strong>Tackle problems: </strong>If there is a underlying difficulty behind your depression, trying to solve this problem might help. Write down the problem, all the different things you could to tackle it and then try the option that is most likely to help.</li><li><strong>Stay hopeful:</strong> Remember that many other people have had depression.

<!-- current therapy-->
<p><strong>Your responses to these questions indicate you are currently receiving psychological therapy for your mental health.</strong></p><p></p><p><br></p><p>Because the ECoWeB study is focused on promoting mental health and preventing poor mental health in the future, rather than treating current difficulties, and we are testing the effect of the self-help apps, currently receiving psychological therapy means that this study is not suitable for you at this time.
