<b>ECoWeB Information Pages</b><br><br>The following information sheet has been created to tell you all about the ECoWeB trial. If you still have questions after reading it then do get it touch, our contact details are at the end of the document. There is also a box to tick to indicate you have read the information.&nbsp
<div class="container"><b>
Assessing and Enhancing Emotional Competence for Well-Being (ECoWeB) in the Young: Version 0.8 Dated 27.01.2020&nbsp;</b>
<br><br><b>What is ECoWeB about?</b>
This project aims to increase  insight into how emotions work and the skills of spotting, understanding, and managing emotions in young people. We ask young people to take part in the study over one year to find out what influences mood, how emotions change over time, and which emotional skills best increase well-being.
<br><br>
<b>What will I have to do?</b>
We ask you to complete questions about emotions, emotional skills and well-being 4 times on our website. These questions will be asked at the start of the study and then at follow-ups after 1 month, 3 months, and 12 months. We also ask you to use  a mobile health App for at least several weeks to monitor your emotions in daily life. We will offer some people self-help strategies and workouts within the App to improve their Emotional Fitness and well-being. This is so we can learn what approaches best improve well-being in young people. Who get which version of the App will be decided by chance. 
<br><br>
<b>What payment will I receive?</b>
As a thank you and reward for completing the follow-up questions and for using the App, you will be sent electronic shopping vouchers after you complete your 3 and 12 month follow up. The value will depend on your use of the App (up to £30) and completing the 1, 3 and 12 month follow up assessments (each £10 reward).  
<br><br>
<b>Why take part and what are the possible advantages of taking part? </b>
By taking part you will play a major role in understanding emotion and improving well-being and mental health for young people. Taking part may help you to learn about, understand and better manage your own emotions. It will also help us to improve well-being and mental health for other young people. The self-help strategies can reduce worry and boredom and improve self-confidence, optimism, motivation, and  recognition and understanding of emotions. This project will test this via an App for the first time on a large scale.  
<br><br>
​<b>Who can take part? </b>
Young adults aged from 16-22 years old in the UK, Spain, Germany and Belgium. We ask you to complete online questionnaires to see if the study is likely to be right for you. If you have depression or suicidal thoughts or have ever had a diagnosis of, or treatment for depression, bipolar disorder (mania) or psychosis, you cannot take part. This is because the study and the App focus on promoting well-being and preventing poor mental health rather than  treating current problems. If you can’t take part, our automated pages can direct you to other sources of help and advice, and you can find more information at our website at <a href="https://www.mymoodcoach.com/mental-health-information">www.mymoodcoach.com</a>. 
<br><br>
<b>Allocation to the Self-help App </b>
All eligible individuals are selected at chance to either continue with the App to monitor emotions (1/3) or offered additional self-help and training in the App (2/3 chance). Of those offered additional self-help, half receive strategies tailored to them based on their assessment results. The other half will receive general strategies. By comparing these groups, we will find which self-help best improves emotional skills, confidence and well-being over 12 months. 
<br><br>
<b>How do I access the App?</b>
If the study is likely to be right for you, we will send you a link via email to access the MyMoodCoach App on your mobile phone (iOS 9 or later, and Android version 5.0 or later).  
<br><br>
<b>How long do I need to use the App? </b>
You can use the App for as long as you like during your year in the trial.  We recommend using it most days for at least a month to get the most benefit. 
<br><br>
<b>Do I have to take part? </b>
No, it is up to you to decide whether or not to take part. If you agree to take part you will need to sign a consent form online. If you take part, you are free to withdraw at any time without giving a reason. 
<br><br>
<b>Parental Consent</b>
In the UK the legal age of consent to take part in research is 16, so you do not need to gain parental consent.
<br><br>
<b>Is my data confidential and private?</b>
All information collected about you will normally be kept strictly confidential. The main exception is if in an email or a telephone call with us, you reported significant difficulties or risk of harm to yourself. In this case, we may contact your doctor (if you provide their contact details), and your parent or guardian if you are under 18 in Belgium or Germany.  If you are over 18 then only if we couldn’t reach you and were concerned would we telephone your trusted contact to try to locate you. 
Your information will be kept confidential and stored securely and password protected. Your contact details (name, email, telephone number) will be kept separately from all other data. Your responses on the website and the App will be only linked to a project identification number, not with your contact details, to keep your personal responses private. The third party electronic shopping voucher provided will be given your name and email address only (but no other information) so they can send you access to the vouchers you have earnt. Your contact details will not be used by any party for sales or marketing purposes. 
<br><br>
<b>Who can access  my data?</b>
Only members of the EU funded ECoWeb consortium will have access to your data during the study. This is so they can contact you about follow-ups or to respond to your questions or requests for help. Other project researchers will only have access to the information you enter into the Website and the App. After the study ends it may be that academic journals and other research teams will ask for the data from the study to be made public (so they can carry out further research or check our findings).  The data they use will not include your name or any of your contact details. This is so they can contact you about follow-ups or to respond to your questions or requests for help. Other project researchers will only have access to the information you enter into the Website and the App. After the study ends it may be that academic journals and other research teams will ask for the data from the study to be made public (so they can carry out further research or check our findings). The data they use will be anonymous and not included your name or any of your contact details.
<br><br>
​<b>How long will my data be held?</b>
Your contact details will be held until the end of the project (December 2021). You can also ask for your other data to be deleted at any time until this point. Your other data will be kept for 7 years for research purposes only in line with good research practice. Our data protection and privacy policy is provided with this information sheet. 
<br><br>
<b>Research into Mood and Voice </b>
We hope to develop new ways to detect emotions from the voice to help young people to get aid quickly when needed.  Anyone in the study can take part in the voice research. The choice to take part is in the Emotion Diary in the App. In the Emotion Diary, you are asked to describe an emotional events from that day. You can type this event into the app. Or you can talk to the app to create a voice record.   
<br><br>
<b>Voice recording </b>
If you record your voice, it will be automatically analysed on the App. This will find sound qualities such as pitch and tone. To ensure confidentiality, each recording will be broken up into tiny bits and irreversibly scrambled beyond recognition on the app. This means that the tone of your voice can be heard but no-one can hear what you said. This is to protect your identity. The files will then be labelled with your study identity number, encrypted and sent  to a secure server for further analysis by our specialist researchers. If you use the voice recording, you will get feedback on how your voice might sound to others.
There is no passive monitoring on the App.  You have to actively choose to record your voice by clicking the record button.  
<br><br>
<b>Do I have to record my voice? </b>
No, this is completely optional and voluntary. You are only given the choice to record your voice when describing an emotional event.  
<br><br>
<b>What if I want to withdraw from the study or delete my data? </b>
You can withdraw from using the App or taking part in the study at any time without giving us a reason. If you are willing to let us still use your data that is really useful. You can request to have your data deleted at any time until the end of December 2021 when we will delete all contact details from the dataset. 
<br><br>
<b>What are the possible disadvantages of taking part?</b>
Taking part involves  giving your time to complete the questionnaires and use the App. Because some questions and the App ask about past and present emotions, there is a small chance that this may produce mild and brief upset if you are reminded of an unpleasant event. However, this would be no more than usually experienced in daily life. We are not aware of any other side effects, disadvantages or risks of using the App. 
<br><br>
<b>What help is provided?</b>
The ECoWeB study only offers self-monitoring and self-help. It does not provide therapy. The App is not directly monitored nor supported by clinicians or therapists. If you report increased distress or thoughts of harming yourself on our website, we will give you automated advice and point you to sources of help. You can also contact us for further advice at any time and we will (wherever possible) respond within 2 working days. Your GP (family doctor) remains responsible for your medical care. It is your responsibility to contact them for further help.  
<br><br>
<b>What will happen to the results?</b>
We will analyse the information received from all those taking part together at the end of the study. We aim to publish the work in academic journals. Your identity will not be revealed in any report or publication. We will publish a summary of the findings on our website. We will also send this report to all participants who request it.   
<br><br>
<b>Who has reviewed the study? </b>
This study has been reviewed and given a favourable opinion by the research ethic committees of the participating Universities. In the UK approval has been given by the Psychology Research Ethics Committee and the contact for this committee is Dr Nick Moberly whom you can email at <a href="mailto:n.j.moberly@exeter.ac.uk">n.j.moberly@exeter.ac.uk</a>, telephone <a href="tel:01392 724656">01392 724656</a>.

<div class="container"><b>ECoWeb Study Privacy and Personal Data Protection Policy Version 0.5 dated 27.01.2019</b><br>
<br>
<b>What will my data be collected for?</b> The legal basis for your data collection is for the purpose of research carried out in the public interest and we will use your contact information for the purpose of contacting you about the trial. The consortium is a research group of Universities and collaborating companies. We are investigating the role of emotional skills (emotional intelligence or emotional fitness) in the well-being of young people by following them over one year. It includes the opportunity to use a self-help mobile app. We will test if the app improves wellbeing in young people.<br>
<br>
<b>Who will have access to my data?</b> Only members of the EU funded ECoWeb consortium will have access to your data during the study. After the study ends it may be that academic journals and other research teams will ask for data from the study to be made public (so they can carry out further research or check our findings). The data they use will not include your name or any of your contact details.<br>
<br>
There are 4 places in the Solution* that your data can be stored, accessed, processed:
<ul>
 <li>The data you enter when you complete your first assessment and complete follow ups will be collected through a third-party specialist survey website called Qualtrics. You will access this website through our website www.mymoodcoach.com.</li>
 <li>The University of Exeter Clinical Trials unit will collect and store messages sent via our website and data entered into our Qualtrics survey website.</li>
 <li>Data from the App will be collected and stored by our technical collaborator Monsenso (a Danish technical partner in the consortium) before being sent to the Exeter Clinical Trials Unit.</li>
 <li>Voice files recorded on the App will be irreversibly scrambled beyond recognition,, collected and stored on a secure server hosted by STRATO before being downloaded and stored for analysis by AuDEERING (a German technical partner in the consortium). This data and analysis will be sent on to the Exeter Clinical Trials unit.
 </li></ul><br>
The collected data held at the Exeter Clinical Trials unit will be securely transferred without your contact details within the ECoWeB consortium. Data will be transferred so that partners can analyse the data and answer scientific questions.&nbsp;
<br>
All data transfer will be encrypted and kept securely on password-protected secure servers. Data on traffic to our website will be collected using google analytics. This is to help us know who is using the different pages on the site. This data will not be linked to your contact details.<br>
<br>
*The Solution is the IT network that collects, transfers and stores your data during the trial **Personal Data will not be sold, leased, transferred, shared, or otherwise accessed by or to any third parties**<br>
<br>
<b>Who are the data controllers and data processors? </b> 
The University of Exeter is the ‘Data Controller’ for ECoWeb. The Council of the University, as the governing body, is ultimately responsible for compliance with current data protection legislation. The University will take the appropriate measures to ensure compliance and to protect data subject’s rights under the legislation. Our technical partners Monsenso and AuDEERING are data processors because they will collect data from you via the App. Our recruitment sites (Ludwig Maximilian University, Germany; Gent University, Belgium; Universitat Jaume I of Castellón, Spain)) will also be data processors. They will receive data for analyses and to contact participants living in their country.<br>
<br>
All data processors have signed legal Data Processing Agreements with the Data Controller (the University of Exeter) to ensure that your data is collected, transferred, processed and stored according to General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).<br>
<br>
The Data Controller is responsible for and is able to demonstrate compliance to GDPR regulations. Under GDPR regulations you have the following rights:<br>
&nbsp;
<ul>
 <b>GDPR 1. The right to be informed</b> This refers to your right to know what data will be collected from you, when, how and why and to give voluntary consent for this. The following sections describe the uses for the different types of data:<br>
 <br>
 <b>What information do we want to collect?</b><br>
 <br>
 <b>Personal Contact information</b> We want to collect your name, address, phone number, email addresses, age, gender and country. We need your contact details so we can get in touch with you with information about the study. This includes sending you a copy of the study information sheet, consent form and this data protection information. We need your email to set you up on the app, to send password reminders if you forget your password, to send links and reminders for the follow-up assessments and vouchers for completing the tasks, and to contact you if you raise questions or report suicide risk .We will keep your contact information while you are in the study to contact you.
 These contact details will be only provided to the team in your recruitment country (UK, Spain, Germany, Belgium), to our partner Monsenso so they can set you up on the app and to a third-party electronic shopping voucher provider who will use this information to give you access to their website so you can access and spend your Shopping vouchers. Your details will not be passed to anyone for sales or marketing purposes. <br>
 Your information will be kept confidential and stored securely and password protected. Your contact details (name, email, telephone number) will be kept separately from all other data. Your contact details will be destroyed at the end of the study (December 2021). Your responses on the App will be only linked to a project identification number, not with your contact details, to keep your personal responses private. Your other data will be kept for another 7 years, in line with good research practice. We are unable to destroy your data once it has been anonymised and this routinely happens at the end of the study in December 2021.
 All staff accessing your personal data are trained in data protection and confidentiality. 
 <br>
 <b>Parental Contact details</b> If you are aged 16-17 and live in Germany or Belgium then we will ask for your parent’s name and email, so they can give their permission for you to enter the study. If you live in the UK then you are legally able to give consent to take part without parental permission.Parental contact details are protected in the same way as participant contact details.<br>
 <br>
 <b>Health and Emotion Information</b> The website will ask you questions about your health and wellbeing, your emotions and your emotional skills, and your family background. We need this to check the study is right for you. We also need it to conduct research into how emotions, emotional skills, and well-being change over time in young people. We will examine what influences wellbeing over time. We will test which self-help strategies in the app might be most helpful.<br>
 <br>
 <b>App usage and responses</b> We will collect data on how you use the App. This includes how often you use it, which elements you use, etc. We will also collect your responses on the App, such as the scores or answers you enter. We collect this data so we learn what is helpful or not in the App and improve it. This App content information will be stored with an identity number separately from your contact information. Your camera, messages, phone calls, contacts and location will not be accessed, read, listened to or recorded at any time.<br>
 <br>
 <b>IP address </b> Our specialist survey site, Qualtrics, need to store your IP (internet) address for their system to work and store and link all of your data. Qualtrics processes have been reviewed by the data controller and found to be GDPR compliant.<br>
 <br>
 <b>Technical data</b> The website and the App routinely collect technical data such as hardware configuration, software configuration, access provider, data exchanges and use of our websites. We collect this so that we can run the website and App efficiently and keep your data secure. Technical data will not be linked to your contact information unless you ask us for technical support as we will need to contact you to provide help.<br>
 <br>
 <b>Voice recordings</b> We will collect voice recordings for those users who choose to describe an emotional event vocally. Voice recording is optional. You have to actively choose to record your voice by clicking the record button. The voice recording is automatically analysed on the App. The analysis will identify sound qualities such as pitch and tone. To ensure confidentiality, each recording will be broken up into tiny bits and irreversibly scrambled beyond recognition on the app. This means that no-one can hear what you said and therefore hides your identity. This content-free file will be encrypted and sent to a secure server. The voice data is collected to support research into identifying emotions from the voice.<br>
 <br>
 <b>Study Monitoring</b> The trial manager and site research teams regularly monitor the results of the study so we can report on how the study is going to our Study Steering Committee. Participant wellbeing is reported to the relevant committee, only if this is needed. In either case, contact details are not included in the reports.
<br><br></ul>
For GDPR rights 2 to 6, we can only respond to these requests whilst we still have your contact details linked to your data.<br>
&nbsp;
<ul>
<b>GDPR 2. The right of access</b> This refers to your right to be able to check what data is being held on you. You can write to us at any time asking to know what personal information is being held where and for what purpose. We must respond within one month.<br>
 <br>
 <b>GDPR3. The right to rectification</b> This refers to your right to be able to correct any information that is incorrect. You can write to us to ask for any incorrect personal data about you to be corrected. You can expect for this to be done within one month.<br>

To ensure confidentiality, each recording will be broken up into tiny bits and irreversibly scrambled beyond recognition on the app. This means that the tone of your voice can be heard but no-one can hear what you said. This is to protect your identity. The files will then be labelled with your study identity number, encrypted and sent  to a secure server for further analysis by our specialist researchers. If you use the voice recording, you will get feedback on how your voice might sound to others.<br><br> There is no passive monitoring on the App.  You have to actively choose to record your voice by clicking the record button.</div>

<div class="heading">Do I have to record my voice?</div>
<div id="info15" class="info">No, this is completely optional and voluntary. You are only given the choice to record your voice when describing an emotional event.</div>

<div class="heading">What if I want to withdraw from the study or delete my data?</div>
<div id="info16" class="info">You can withdraw from using the App or taking part in the study at any time without giving us a reason. If you are willing to let us still use your data that is really useful. You can request to have your data deleted at any time until the end of December 2021. If you would like your data deleted email <a href="mailto:mymoodcoach@exeter.ac.uk"mymoodcoach@exeter.ac.uk></a></div>

<div class="heading">What are the possible disadvantages of taking part?</div>
<div id="info17" class="info">Taking part involves  giving your time to complete the questionnaires and use the App. Because some questions and the App ask about past and present emotions, there is a small chance that this may produce mild and brief upset if you are reminded of an unpleasant event. However, this would be no more than usually experienced in daily life. We are not aware of any other side effects, disadvantages or risks of using the App.<br></br>The ECoWeB study only offers self-monitoring and self-help. It does not provide therapy. The App is not directly monitored nor supported by clinicians or therapists. If you report increased distress or thoughts of harming yourself on our website, we will give you automated advice and point you to sources of help. You can also contact us for further advice at any time and we will (wherever possible) respond within 2 working days. Your GP (family doctor) remains responsible for your medical care. It is your responsibility to contact them for further help. </div>

<div class="heading">What will happen to the results?</div>
<div id="info18" class="info">We will analyse the information received from all those taking part together at the end of the study. We aim to publish the work in academic journals. Your identity will not be revealed in any report or publication. We will publish a summary of the findings on our website. We will also send this report to all participants who request it.</div>
